# ApplyMate

I built **ApplyMate** to help me — and people like me — manage job applications, track progress, and automate parts of the job-search workflow.

---

## 🎯 What is ApplyMate

I created ApplyMate because job hunting is messy. I used to juggle spreadsheets, saved job links, notes, follow-up reminders — it quickly gets chaotic. ApplyMate gives me a single place to:

- Add jobs I apply to or plan to apply for.
- Track status (applied, interviewing, offer, rejected, follow-up, etc.).
- Keep relevant information like company name, role, link, notes, dates.
- Get organized so I never lose track of where I applied, when I should follow up, or what next steps are.

Over time I plan to add more features: resume upload & review, outreach helper, reminders, analytics. But even the core app helps turn chaos into clarity.

## 🧰 Why I built this

I’m a graduate student and aspiring software engineer. I want to show that I can build real, full-stack systems from scratch. With ApplyMate I get to exercise backend, frontend, database, deployment, and eventually automation.

It’s not just a toy — it’s a tool I’ll actually use, and a portfolio project that reflects my skills end-to-end.

I believe this will demonstrate to potential employers that I can: design, implement, and deploy complete software systems; manage data flow; build a clean UI; and plan for growth and maintainability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (initial plan)

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: Next.js or React + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL (or a similar relational DB to start)
- Containerization: Docker (for local dev & future deployment)
- Infrastructure as code (future): Terraform or AWS CDK
- Deployment target (future): AWS (ECS / Lambda / RDS / S3 etc.)

---

## 📂 Repo Structure (so far / planned)

- /backend
- /frontend
- /infrastructure
- README.md

I’ll expand this as I add more services — like notifications, outreach helper, resume review, etc.

---

## ✅ Current Status & Next Steps

**What’s done so far:**

- Repository created with basic folder structure

**What I’m focusing on next:**

- Build the backend skeleton and core job-tracker APIs (create, read, update, delete job entries)
- Build a simple frontend UI to add/list/manage jobs
- Ensure local development works reliably

**Planned later:**

- Add user authentication (signup / login)
- Persist data in a database
- Containerize with Docker
- (Optionally) add resume upload / review, analytics, notifications, outreach helper
- Deploy to cloud with CI/CD

## 🚀 How to Run Locally (once implementation starts)

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tharanitharan-M/applymate.git
   cd ApplyMate
   ```

2. Go into the backend folder, install dependencies, and start the API server (e.g. via uvicorn).
3. Go into the frontend folder, install dependencies, and start the development server.
4. Use the UI to add, view, and manage job applications.

## 🔭 What I’m Learning / Aiming to Demonstrate

• Ability to build full-stack web applications (frontend + backend + database)
• Understanding of clean code structure, modular design, good practices
• DevOps / deployment readiness: containerization, environment setup, (eventually) cloud infra
• Automation mindset: making tedious tasks simpler and more efficient
• Real-world problem solving — a tool that I actually use during job search
